Complete the implementation of unfinished methods in various classes, such as:

Enemy movement and AI logic in enemy.py
Boss ability generation, movement, AI, and ability usage logic in boss.py
Item spawning, usage, and interaction logic in items.py
A* pathfinding algorithm in utilities.py
In the main.py file, create instances of the necessary classes and integrate them into the main game loop:

Create a GameMap, Player, EnemyManager, BossManager, ItemManager, and UIManager instance
Update and render these instances as needed during the game loop
Add input handling to control the player character and interact with the game world
Integrate the save system into the game by implementing the following:

Saving and loading functions that store and retrieve game state from the file system
Incorporate these functions into the main game loop, game state management, and user interface
Fine-tune the configuration settings in config.py for a balanced and engaging gameplay experience:

Adjust tile sizes, movement speeds, health values, and other game settings as needed
Test and debug the game thoroughly to ensure proper functionality, performance, and user experience:

Identify and fix any bugs or performance issues that arise during testing
Refine game mechanics and balance to create a fun and challenging game experience
